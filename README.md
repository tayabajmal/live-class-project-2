Creator : Tayab Ajmal
Date : 20th of July, 2022.

Task at hand : Based on the given Figma file named 2.png, re-create the website using HTML and CSS only.

Time spent to complete this project : 4 hours. 

As this website is not responsive yet, it may show up differently on different screensizes. I have therefore taken a screenshot of how the final result looked like when I finished the project. The screenshot can be seen under the assets folder and named "final_result_tayabajmal.project2jpg". 

## Learning
---

I learnt a lot about how to position HTML elements on a webpage and how to use techniques like flexbox and positioning. I also learnt about how to work with transitions on background images. 

## Improvements
---
Several improvements could be done to this project, like making the website responsive using media queries. At the time of completing the project, responsive webdesign had not been covered. Also, the heading could have been wrapped at a smaller width. Instaead it is going too wide.
